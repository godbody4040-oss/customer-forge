/**
 * Claim-to-feature registry.
 *
 * Every capability Revora advertises to a client is listed here together with
 * the module that implements it and the test that proves it. `claim-registry.test.ts`
 * fails the build if a claimed capability has no implementation or no test, so a
 * marketing promise can never drift ahead of the product.
 *
 * `live` answers a different question: whether the capability is switched on for
 * *this* workspace right now. A claim can be implemented but not yet live.
