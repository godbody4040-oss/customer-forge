/**
 * The single account-access model for Revora.
 *
 * Revora has no credit, token or per-build charge of any kind. Builder usage
 * (generation, editing, regeneration, audits, fixes, previews, rollbacks,
 * publishing) is included with the customer's access, so the ONLY question this
 * module answers is: does this workspace currently have access?
 *
 * States and their rules:
 *   TRIAL                — inside the free full-access window. Full builder access.
 *   ACTIVE_SETUP         — one-time setup fee paid. Full builder access.
 *   ACTIVE_SUBSCRIPTION  — monthly subscription active. Full builder access.
 *   PAST_DUE             — payment failed; grace access so work is never lost.
 *   CANCELED             — subscription canceled and no setup payment on file.
 *   EXPIRED              — free access ended without payment.
 *   SUSPENDED            — platform-level suspension.
 *
 * Nothing here may ever report a credit shortage as a reason.
