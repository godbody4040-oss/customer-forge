/**
 * REVORA BUILDER QUEUE — pure state for queued requests and editable plans.
 *
 * The owner can line up several requests ("make the home page premium", "add a
 * services page", "improve mobile") and Revora works through them one at a
 * time. Each request produces a plan whose steps can be edited, skipped,
 * reordered or removed before anything touches the draft.
 *
 * Pure functions only: no network, no timers. The panel owns the effects, so
 * the state machine can be tested exactly as the owner experiences it.
