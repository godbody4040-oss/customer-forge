/**
 * REVORA COMMAND ROUTER — one natural-language entry point for the whole
 * platform.
 *
 * The owner types what they want in normal words. This module works out which
 * subsystem actually owns that work and returns a concrete destination: the
 * website assistant, the generator, Pre-Flight, self-healing, the domain panel,
 * billing, leads, quotes, booking, automations, analytics or media.
 *
 * It never claims to have done the work. It returns where the work happens and,
 * for assistant work, the instruction to hand over. Anything it can't place with
 * confidence goes to the assistant with `confident: false`, so the UI can say so
 * honestly instead of guessing.
