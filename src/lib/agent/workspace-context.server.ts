/**
 * PROJECT UNDERSTANDING LAYER — the agent's memory of a workspace.

 * the planner a compact summary instead of the whole tree where a summary is
 * enough, and is invalidated the moment anything is written.
 *
 * Server-only and per-instance: it is a cache, never a source of truth. Every
 * write path still reads the database directly and clears the entry.
