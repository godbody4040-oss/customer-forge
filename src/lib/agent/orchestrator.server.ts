/**
 * THE REVORA AGENT ORCHESTRATOR.
 *
 * UNDERSTAND → PLAN → EXECUTE → REFLECT → VERIFY → REPORT.
 *
 * This module owns the pipeline itself and nothing else: understanding comes
 * from `understanding.server`, the workspace picture from
 * `workspace-context.server`, the plan from the site planner, and the writes
 * from `applyWebsiteChanges` after the owner approves. Keeping the stages apart
 * is what lets the agent grow without rewriting the builder.
 *
 * Two honesty rules are enforced here, not just prompted:
 * - a requirement is only reported as covered when the review pass says so, and
 * - reflection is skipped for simple requests, so a small ask stays cheap.
