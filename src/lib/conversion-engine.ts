/**
 * Revora conversion engine.
 *
 * Every website Revora builds is organised around ONE primary business goal.
 * This module turns that goal into an ordered ladder of conversion paths
 * (CALL → TEXT → BOOK → REQUEST QUOTE → CONTACT), the sections a page must carry
 * to support it, and the objections that have to be answered before a stranger
 * will act.
 *
 * Pure and browser-safe: it only reports what the workspace facts support, so a
 * path is never advertised when the underlying capability is missing.
