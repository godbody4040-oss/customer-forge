/**
 * Regression guards for the two write paths that must stay all-or-nothing.
 *
 * The real transactional behaviour lives in Postgres (`submit_public_conversion`
 * and `restore_website_state`), and it is verified directly against the database.
 * These tests stop the application code from quietly drifting back to a chain of
 * separate inserts, which is what previously allowed a half-saved booking or a
 * half-restored website.
