/**
 * REVORA AGENT CAPABILITY REGISTRY.
 *
 * The agent is general purpose: the owner describes an outcome and the agent
 * works out the method. This registry is the honest map of what "the method"
 * can actually be inside a Revora workspace — every capability here is wired to
 * something the platform really does, so the planner is never told it can do
 * something the executor cannot.
 *
 * Pure data + pure helpers: no model, no database, no side effects.
