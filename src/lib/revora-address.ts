/**
 * REVORA ADDRESSES.
 *
 * There are exactly three kinds of web address in this product:
 *
 *   1. `revoragrowthsystems.com` — the ONLY Revora platform domain (dashboard,
 *      builder, billing, CRM) and the host of every client share/preview path
 *      at `/s/<slug>`.
 *   2. `revoraweb.site` — TRAFFIC ONLY. The apex, `www`, and every possible
 *      label under it exist solely to redirect visitors to the platform domain.
 *      It is never an application origin and never hosts a website.
 *   3. A customer-owned domain, verified for DNS and HTTPS — the client's real
 *      public website address.
 *
 * Revora-branded client subdomains do not exist. There is intentionally no
 * helper in this module that can build, claim, check or resolve one; any such
 * host is structurally rejected as a tenant.
 *
 * Browser-safe: pure string work only.
