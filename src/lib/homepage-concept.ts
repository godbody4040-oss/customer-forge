/**
 * Revora's own homepage visual concept.
 *
 * Produced by the builder's "Create something new" creative command
 * (`inventComposition`, daring mode) using Revora's own business facts, then
 * pinned here so the marketing homepage renders the exact approved concept on
 * every request (no per-visit randomness, no server work, SSR-safe).
 *
 * Palettes were locked to the Revora dark + gold identity; every other value is
 * the generated one. Safety, mobile behaviour and reduced-motion handling come
 * from the same validated engine the client builder uses.
