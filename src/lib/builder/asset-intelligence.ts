/**
 * REVORA ASSET INTELLIGENCE ENGINE
 * =================================
 *
 * Free-first asset planning engine.
 *
 * This is NOT an image generator and does not require an AI API. It does not
 * decide what an asset should LOOK like — that is `visual-intelligence.ts`'s
 * job. This engine decides what image/logo SLOTS a site actually needs, how
 * many, at what shape, and — most importantly — which of those slots may
 * ever be filled with a decorative or stock image versus which must only
 * ever come from the business itself.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * This module never fabricates, generates, or sources an asset. It plans
 * slots only. A "must_be_real" slot with nothing supplied is a gap to
 * report, never a placeholder to quietly fill.
