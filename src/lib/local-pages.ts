/**
 * Programmatic local landing pages: one page per (industry × US state).
 *
 * Every fact on these pages is derived from verifiable public geography
 * (`US_STATES` metros) and Revora's own immutable offer (`GROWTH_SYSTEM`).
 * Nothing is invented — no fake statistics, no fake reviews, no claimed
 * physical offices. Revora is a remote service-area business, so the copy
 * always says "serves", never "located in".
 *
 * These pages exist to earn organic search traffic for the searches local
 * business owners actually type ("hvac website design texas", "plumber lead
 * generation ohio"), and every one of them links back into the real product.
