/**
 * Makes Revora's AI concrete and shows the automation engine visually.
 *
 * Three additive blocks:
 *  - AiClarity: exactly what the AI does, in the client's words, with the human
 *    control that stays in place (no vague "AI-powered" claims).
 *  - AutomationFlow: the trigger -> action -> outcome visual.
 *  - SleepEngine: "your business grows while you sleep" framed as a mechanism.
