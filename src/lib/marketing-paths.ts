/**
 * One definition of what counts as marketing traffic for revoragrowthsystems.com.
 *
 * Revora's own admin and workspace screens are staff tools, not marketing pages:
 * counting them would inflate the funnel with the owner's own clicks. Tenant
 * preview paths are customer websites, so they must never leak into platform
 * reporting either.
 *
 * The browser skips these paths when recording, and every admin report filters
 * them again, so rows recorded before this rule existed are excluded too.
