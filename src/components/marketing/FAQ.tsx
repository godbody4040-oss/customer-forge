  {
    q: "What is Revora?",
    a: "Revora is a growth operating system for local service businesses. It brings your website, lead capture, quotes, bookings, follow-up automation, review requests and analytics into one dashboard.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an existing website?",
    a: "No. Revora can build and host a conversion-focused business site for you, on a Revora address or your own domain.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I connect my existing website?",
    a: "Yes — you can keep your current site and connect it to Revora. Traffic reporting for an external site requires installing the Revora tracking snippet on it; until real events arrive, Revora shows the connection as waiting for data rather than connected.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can Revora track website traffic?",
    a: "Yes, for sites Revora builds and for connected external sites once the tracking snippet is installed and configured. Analytics only ever show events that were actually recorded.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is traffic tracking real-time?",
    a: "Live activity appears only after real tracking events are received. With no traffic, Revora tells you there are no active visitors instead of showing a made-up number.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Revora guarantee customers?",
    a: "No. Revora gives you the system, the follow-up and the measurement. Nobody can honestly guarantee leads, rankings or revenue, and we don't.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does pricing work?",
    a: `One offer: ${usdExact(GROWTH_SYSTEM.setupPrice)} one-time setup to build, customize and launch your system, then ${usdExact(GROWTH_SYSTEM.monthlyPrice)}/month for the platform, automation, hosting, updates, growth services and support.`,
  },
  {
    q: "Can I cancel?",
    a: "Yes. You can cancel from billing at any time and keep access until the end of the paid period. Your data is preserved.",
  },

  {
    q: "Can I use my own domain?",
    a: "Yes. Connect a domain you already own from the Domain Center, follow the DNS steps, and Revora verifies DNS and HTTPS before reporting the domain as live.",
  },
  {
    q: "What businesses can use Revora?",
    a: "Local service businesses — detailing, hair and beauty, barbers, cleaning, landscaping, pressure washing, HVAC, plumbing, roofing, contractors and similar trades.",
  },
